        Hi, my name is Tzvi ('Steve') Neiman, and I am a full-stack developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I currently work for JCM Living as a Software Developer while taking
        night classes at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before changing my role at JCM Living, I was a Property Manager there
        for seven years. So when I decided to change Careers, I started with
        tweaking and adding new features to help the company be more productive
        and, at the same time, build helpful components for the end users, which
        for many years was me.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching a bit of TV, and taking time
        to continue building my career skills. My long-term goal is to continue
        growing my career, continue satisfying clients, and help other aspiring
        software developers reach their goals and max potential.
